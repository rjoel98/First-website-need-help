        <section><h5>Child sexual abuse is an adult issue!</h5>
        <p>As adults, we are solely responsible for the safety of children. It's important to teach children how to recognize and avoid risky situations, but it's unrealistic to think that a child can fend off sexual advances by an adult. Fortunately, we can protect them by insisting on prevention policies in our youth serving organizations, by recognizing signs of sexual abuse, and by confronting and stopping abuse if it occurs.</p></section>
