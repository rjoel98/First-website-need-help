# First-website-need-help
I am making this website for my mom. She had a rough one before, and I am really interested in becoming a programmer. I figured this would be a great way to start. Anyways, I really need help with the navigation bar right now. I can't figure out why the dropdowns are behind the body text. But any other recommendations or comments are welcome. Thank you!
